In this is my linklist appication what it does is it takes a list of nodes

and allows you to iterate over the entire list and see the value of each node.

It also lets you insert a node in the first place value or the last place value.

The delete node  and search fuction alows you to look through the list and fine a specit node.

Copylist allows you to copy each node into a new list then the old one will be destroy.
