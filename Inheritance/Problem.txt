1. Create a small program that showcases inheritance, representing transport vehicles.
2. Start off with a base class, TransportVehicle. Think about what properties are common
to all transport vehicles.
3. Derive classes from this, such as Car, Plane, Bike, etc. Give each derived class properties
and functionality (it doesn't need to be fleshed out) that is unique to the derived class.
4. Remember to place your class definitions in separate .h files and your function bodies in
separate .cpp files
5. Make proper use of the public, private and protected keywords
