This is my Fighting game assignment where i attempted to make a fighting simulator.

It would allow you to pick two fighters and have them fight into one is of them has no more HP. 



To play you need to duble click the application.

(Unfortunately it will not start the fight in any way as far as i can tell.)

Next you would then pick your fighter.

Your fighter would then attack your opponent into one of them HP was redusted to 0.

The winner would then be stated at the with how much HP he had left.



I was not able to get it to work, the functions i have i work but the call i have do not.

I have the skeleto of the proble but not much meat to make it work.

I am also trying to get a grop of pointers to work but they are coming back red.

In the end none of it works because the functions/pointers  do not work as expected.
